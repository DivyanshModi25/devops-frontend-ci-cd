# In this project i have configured cloud by 2 methods
- entirely using terraform (even docker installation and setup)
- ec2 instance creation using terraform and docker installation using ansible


#### but for this project since there was only one host machine, using just terraform (method 1) was easier
#### If there were multiple host machines then the method 2 would have made more sense
